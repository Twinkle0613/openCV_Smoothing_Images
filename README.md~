In this lesson, I am going to explain how to smooth an image. Sometimes it is also called blurring. The main objective of smoothing is to reduce noise. Such noise reduction is a typical image pre-processing method which will improve the final result.
There are various ways to smooth or blur an image. I will explain you of most common smoothing techniques with OpenCV C++ examples.

1) Homogeneous Smoothing
2) Gaussian Smoothing
3) Median Smoothing
4) Bilateral Smoothing


Smoothing is done by sliding a window (kernel or filter) across the whole image and calculating each pixel a value based on the value of the kernel and the value of overlapping pixels of original image. This process is mathematically called as convolving an image with some kernel. The kernel is the only difference in all of the above types of smoothing (Blurring) methods.
