Smoothing Image

Method: 

1) Homogeneous Smoothing
2) Gaussian Smoothing
3) Median Smoothing
4) Bilateral Smoothing


Smoothing is done by sliding a window (kernel or filter) across the whole image and calculating each pixel a value based on the value of the kernel and the value of overlapping pixels of original image. This process is mathematically called as convolving an image with some kernel. The kernel is the only difference in all of the above types of smoothing (Blurring) methods.
